#ReviewMy.MP
##The best way to show your MPs what you think!

ReviewMy.MP gives Australians the ability to rate members of parliament from their electorate.

Users create an account, select their electorate and are given a list of candidate members for that electorate. There is no political bias and anyone running in the most previous and future elections will be included. If users have a new candidate in their area they fill in a form that alerts admins and the new candidate will be included in ReviewMy.MP.

Users rate candidates on the following:
* Responsiveness to emails, phone calls and letters
* Committment when sticking to election promises
* Percieved corruption
