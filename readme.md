#ReviewMy.MP
####The best way to show your MPs what you think!

###What is it?

ReviewMy.MP gives Australians the ability to rate members of parliament from their electorate.

Users create an account, select their electorate and are given a list of candidate members for that electorate. There is no political bias and anyone running in the most previous and future elections will be included. If users have a new candidate in their area they fill in a form that alerts admins and the new candidate will be included in ReviewMy.MP.

Users rate candidates on the following:
* Responsiveness to emails, phone calls and letters
* Committment when sticking to election promises
* Percieved corruption

###Technology Involved
ReviewMy.MP is made on the LAMA stack. It uses the following technology

* [**L**aravel](http://www.laravel.com)
* [**A**ngularJS](http://www.angularjs.org)
* [**M**ySQL](http://www.mysql.com)
* [**A**pache](http://httpd.apache.org)

Each piece of the LAMA stack has it's own dependencies and if you're looking at contributing or starting your own project based off of ReviewMy.MP it will be best to review each piece of the puzzle and listen to them about requirements and help getting started.
